residential service app

This residential service application was created with the focus to combine several useful features required in the day-to-day lives
of every resident, and make them available at a single place which is easy to access and use. Including features like a complaint station 
for users to lodge problems they might be facing (leaking ceilings, dirty surroundings etc), a notice board section for the administrators 
to upload necessary updates about meetings and important information and updates about happenings or events and a similar screen where 
residents can view them, a social directory screen wherein all the registered users from the society can be viewed, along with the type of 
user they are (user, admin, security) and address.

2) NOTICE BOARD
This feature will work differently for different types of users. If the user is an administrator, they will be able to enter what they want 
to upload as a notice and that will be stored in the database along with the day it was written on. If the user is a resident or security, 
they will only be able to see all the notices stored in the database.
